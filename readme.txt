Python project 1.
The numbers game.

Task:
Below are the steps:
1. Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
2. Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
3. Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses

The game allowes you to set a range.
The computer then selects a number within that range and you can start guessing.
The function will return a messege explaining if the target is higher or lower.
When the correct guess is made the program will return the number or tries it took to guess the number.
Invalid inputs are handled.
